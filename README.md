A Contact Form and Validate Inputs Using JavaScript
JavaScript Contact Form
This project is a simple, standalone contact form built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is designed to demonstrate basic client-side form validation, ensuring that user input meets specific requirements before a form is considered "submitted."

This code is perfect for a beginner learning about front-end web development, as it combines the three core technologies in a single, easy-to-understand file.

Features
HTML Structure: The basic form layout with input fields for name, email, and a message.

CSS Styling: Simple, clean styles to make the form look good and be easy to read.

JavaScript Validation: The core functionality that checks user input for the following rules:

All fields are required and cannot be empty.

The email address is in a valid format (e.g., user@example.com).

Real-time Feedback: Displays a success message for valid submissions or an error message for invalid input.

How to Use
To use this code, simply copy it and save it as a file named index.html. You can then open this file directly in any web browser to see the form in action. No web server is required!

Technologies Used
HTML: For the structure and form elements.

CSS: For the visual styling.

JavaScript: For the input validation logic.
